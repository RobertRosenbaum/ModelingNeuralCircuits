# Modeling Neural Circuits Made Simple

PDF and accompanying Python code for a preliminary draft of the textbook "Modeling Neural Circuits Made Simple" by Robert Rosenbaum.

Stay tuned for news about a final copy-edited and published version that will be available in electronic and print form.

The folder CodeFromBook contains Python notebooks that run simulations to generate the figures from the book. Each notebook is referred to and described in the book. 

I will soon replace this sentence with a link to a Google Colab folder containing the Python notebooks.

Please email any corrections or suggestions to Robert.Rosenbaum@nd.edu and include the term MNCBOOK in the subject line.

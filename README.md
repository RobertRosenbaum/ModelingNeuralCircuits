# Modeling Neural Circuits Made Simple

PDF and accompanying Python code for a preliminary version of the textbook "Modeling Neural Circuits Made Simple" by Robert Rosenbaum.

Stay tuned for news about a nicer copy-edited and published version to come in the near future in electronic and print form.

The folder CodeFromBook contains Python notebooks that run simulations to generate the figures from the book. Each notebook is referred to and described in the book. 

I will soon provide a link to a Google Colab folder with the same code. 

Please email any corrections or suggestions to Robert.Rosenbaum@nd.edu and include the term MNCBOOK in the subject line.
